### Part 5: Guided Exercises

Launch 3D Shaper and 3Space Assistant (as shown in Parts 2 & 3 above).It would be helpful to open up two 3Space Assistant windows as we will be looking at both the designs and the rules for each example. To do this, just run 3Space Assistant twice.

After setting the block definitions and labels for each part (or sub-part) of the following exercise, click the "Two Rules" button, then open up rule.iv and new.iv in 3Space Assistant to view the results.

> 5.1 Exercise 1
> 
> 5.1.1 For the block definitions type in the following values:
> 
> Block 1:
> 
> Width 20  
> Length 40  
> Height 10
> 
> Block 2:
> 
> Width 10  
> Length 40  
> Height 10
> 
> 5.1.2 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 1  
> Block 2: 10
> 
> Solution (exercise 1a) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex1))
> 
> 5.1.3 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 1  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> Solution (exercise 1b) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex1))
> 
> You might remember that we did these two designs in class with Terry -- to get a better understanding of what's going on, it might help to view the designs in hidden line or wireframe mode.
> 
> NOTE: The representation is important -- when we view the design 'as is', the solid blocks seem to merge together and emergent shapes can be seen.
> 
> 5.2 Exercise 2
> 
> 5.2.1 Keep the same block definitions as 5.1, but this time set the X axis rotation to 17 degrees.
> 
> 5.2.2 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 1  
> Block 2: 10
> 
> Solution (exercise 2a) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex2))
> 
> 5.2.3 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 1  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> Solution (exercise 2b) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex2))
> 
> 5.3 Exercise 3
> 
> 5.3.1 Keep the same settings as 5.2, but change Block 2 Length to 30
> 
> 5.3.2 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 1  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> Solution ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex3))
> 
> 5.4 Exercise 4
> 
> 5.4.1 Keep the same settings as 5.3, but change Block 2 Length to 40 and set the Z axis rotation to 23 degrees.
> 
> 5.4.2 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 1  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> Solution ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex4))
> 
> NOTE: For complex designs, you might find it helpful to increase the number of iterations to get a better idea of what's going on.
> 
> 5.5 Exercise 5
> 
> 5.5.1 Keep the same settings as 5.4, but set the Z axis move to 10.
> 
> 5.5.2 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 1  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> Solution ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex5))
> 
> 5.6 Exercise 6
> 
> 5.6.1 Keep the same settings as 5.4, but change Block 2 Width to 1, Length to 80, and Height to 1.
> 
> 5.6.2 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 1  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> Solution (exercise 6a) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex6))
> 
> 5.6.3 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 4  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> and the number of iterations to 20
> 
> Solution (exercise 6b) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex6))
> 
> 5.6.4 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 3  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> and the number of iterations to 8
> 
> Solution (exercise 6c) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex6))
> 
> 5.6.5 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 8  
> Block 2: 9
> 
> Solution (exercise 6d) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex6))
> 
> 5.6.6 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 8  
> Block 2: 10
> 
> Solution (exercise 6e) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex6))
> 
> 5.6.7 Set the labels to:
> 
> Block 1: 8  
> Block 2: 12
> 
> Solution (exercise 6f) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/3dshaper_ex6))
